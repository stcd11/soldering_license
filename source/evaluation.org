** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

- Use the snipping tool and take a screenshot of your progress ladders as they are currently.
- Using the bar graphs, discuss the following:
 1. Which of the Design Engineering(DE) outcomes have you achieved the highest number of points in?
 2. Now explain why you think this is your best outcome.
 3. Which outcome do you have the least points in?
 4. Explain why you think you have the least points in this outcome?
 5. How do you intend to improve on the outcome with the lowest points in your next project.

- Now identify 2 tasks that you feel did not go well *and why*?
- How would you improve on the above 2 tasks if you were to build the project again?

- Self evaluation.
- In your own words, *describe* how you managed the entire Design Engineering process for this project.
- You can include the following:
 1. How well you managed your time?
 2. How well you managed the making?
 3. How well you managed the research?
 4. How well you managed the designing?
- Make sure you explain all of your answers *(Why do you think this)*?
