** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

- Systems & Control is a superb for taking your maths and physics skills, and applying them to problems in the real world.
- You'll develop creativity, problem-solving and practical skills throughout the course, make some excellent products to keep forever, and hopefully enjoy yourself along the way.
- Before we get stuck into anything practical, we need to consider Health & Safety - sensible precautions we take in the Systems labs to avoid injury

- Looking around the room, there are lots of pieces of different equipment. Laser cutters, 3D printers, PCB etch tanks, soldering irons, drills and so on. Some items you might recognise, and others you'll learn about in lessons.
- With a partner, try and come up with some ideas for working safely in a systems lab (Don't run around the room, for instance).
- Look at the equipment you can see around the room. Do you know what any of it does? How might it be able to injure someone? How do you think you could avoid problems?
- Where are lines of stripy tape on the floor. Why do you think they are there?

- Using the words underneath the statements, fill in the missing spaces.
- When finished:
    - Make a 'Systems and Control' folder in your H: drive.
    - Make a 'Year 7' folder inside it
    - Make a '1 - Licence' folder inside that
    - Save your work in this folder, calling it '*Safety.txt*'
- Upload the work to [[https://www.bournetolearn.com][www.BourneToLearn.com]] using the username and password your teacher has given you.
